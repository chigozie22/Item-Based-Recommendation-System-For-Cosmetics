This project employs the concept of item-based similarities to group varieties of cosmetics and help users find similar brands to their preferences based on chemical composition.
Machine Learning Stacks used in the project include the popular clustering model TSNE from sklearns library. Interactive plots where generated using Bokeh Library.

Feel free to comment on how to improve the model based on reducing the large dimensional space generated from the bag of words in the composition dictionary.
